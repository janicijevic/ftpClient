# FTP Client

Ftp client implementation in C.

Currently only connects to a hardcoded server (local filezilla server) through sockets and prints communicated data. No downloading or uploading files :(

## Building

- To build enter `make ftpClient`
- To run enter `./build/ftpClient`
- To build and run enter `make run`
- To clean enter `make clean`

## TODO

[ ] Implement file transfer
[ ] Make Bash-like interface for issuing commands with support for tab and arrow key history
